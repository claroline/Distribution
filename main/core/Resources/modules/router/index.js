 * Creates react router components based on config.

 *   if you use connected components that needs to access route params,
 *   you have to tell them there is a router.
 *   @see https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/redux-integration
 *
 * Example of simple routing config :
 *   [
 *     {path: '',     component: MyComponent, exact: true},
 *     {path: '/:id', component: MyOtherComponent}
 *   ]
 *
 * Example of nested routing config :
 *   [{
 *     path: '/main',
 *     routes: [
 *       {path: '',     component: MyComponent, exact: true},
 *       {path: '/:id', component: MyOtherComponent}
