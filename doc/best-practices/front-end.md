Best Practices : Javascript
=================

Claroline UI is written with a React/redux stack.

Code structure
---------------
* Javascript code MUST be stored in `MyBundle/Resources/modules`.
* Javascript code MUST be served through `webpack`.


JavaScript consideration
---------------
* Code SHOULD be written in ES6.

Third party libraries
---------------
* The set of used libraries SHOULD be as little as possible.
* Before adding a library which is not already included in the project, you MUST discuss about its pros and cons with the community.
* If you only need few functions from a third party library you SHOULD consider writting it yourself. 
* You MUST NOT use jQuery at all.
