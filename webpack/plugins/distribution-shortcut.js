/**
 * Adds a custom resolver that will try to convert internal webpack requests for
 * modules starting with "#/" (i.e by convention, modules located in the
 * distribution package) into requests with a resolved absolute path. Modules
 * are expected to live in the "Resources/modules" directory of each bundle,
 * so that part must be omitted from the import statement.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * import baz from '#/main/core/foo/bar'
 *
 * will be resolved to:
 *
 * /path/to/vendor/claroline/distribution/main/core/Resources/modules/foo/bar
